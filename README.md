# weekly-reports
A tool to analyse weekly trends in the crypto market. Also my first ever program so feedback welcome


Welcome to whoever is readint this. 

This is my first ever project and its purpose is to connect to the Binance Histories API and download all the price data 
over a set period for the selected pair. 

this is then analyised in three seperate methods and then the graph appears on the screen to view the results.

This should make it easy for users to see weekly trends that mmay appear in the market and take advantage of them.

This is my first ever program though so I am very open to feedback.
